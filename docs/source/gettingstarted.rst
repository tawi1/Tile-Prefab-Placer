#. Click the `Create & init MapCreator` button (if you want to change the tool prefab root path, you will need to repeat the previous 2 steps).

	.. note::
		**Required packages:**
		
		* **Editor coroutines** (`com.unity.editorcoroutines`) - unity package which allows developers to run constructs similar to Unityâ€™s monobehaviour based coroutines within the editor using arbitrary objects.
		
		* **Naughty Attributes** (`com.dbrizov.naughtyattributes`) - extension for unity inspector made by Denis Rizov, also you can manually download it from unity asset store `Naughty Attributes <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/naughtyattributes-129996>`_


	.. note::
		**Script define symbols required for the project:**
			* **MAP_EDITOR**
	
#. Set the tile path in the `MapCreator`'s :ref:`cached tab <cachedValues>` where the prefab categories are stored.

#. Add your :ref:`prefabs <prefabs>`.
#. Place the desired prefabs on the scene using various :ref:`modes <modes>`.
#. When the scene is finished, if you have used a large number of :ref:`MapTiles <maptile>`, it may be useful to clean up the scene before make build with :ref:`Map Utils <mapUtils>` tool.
